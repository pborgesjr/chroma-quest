## Accessibility

It was designed to be accessible for people who have color blindness. The game uses different color palettes to make it easy to differentiate between all buttons. This allows players who have difficulty distinguishing between colors to play the game with ease.

## Game Rules

The game has four colored buttons - red, green, blue, and yellow. The buttons will light up in a sequence, and the player has to press the buttons in the same sequence. If the player presses the buttons in the correct sequence, the game will add one to the score and play another sequence of buttons. If the player makes a mistake, the game will end.
